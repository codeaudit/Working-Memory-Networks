Working [Memory Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895), are a Memory Network architecture with a novel working memory storage and relational reasoning module.
The model retains the relational reasoning abilities of the [Relation Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427) while reducing its computational complexity considerably. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the jointly trained [bAbI-10k](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05698) dataset, with an average error of less than 0.5%.
